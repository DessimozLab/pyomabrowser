									<p>Yes, we are reachable by email at contact@omabrowser.org. However, for general
										questions about OMA, our preferred way of answering questions is through <a
											href="https://www.biostars.org/">BioStars</a>. Please consider asking your
										question
										there, <b>including the tags "OMA" and "orthologs"</b>. We monitor BioStars for
										such
										questions and will answer them directly on that platform.</p>

									<p>We strive to include as many complete genomes as possible, provided they are
										released publicly and meet reasonable quality standards. We are open for
										suggestions and are willing to adapt our priority queue based on user requests.
										The best way is to fill a request for a <a href="{% url "genome_suggestion" %}">new or updated genome</a>.
                                        For more informal information or batch

									<p>If you want to analyze your "own" genomes, you can use the <a
										href="http://omabrowser.org/standalone/">OMA standalone pipeline</a> to do so
										and even make use of already analyzed genomes using the export function. OMA
										standalone is licenced under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0. In a
										nutshell, OMA standalone is open source and free for commercial and

								<div class="card-body">
									<p>OMA Groups are sets of genes which are all orthologous to each other according to
										the definition of Fitch (1970). In presence of a duplication in certain gene
										familly, this grouping strategy will pick only one of the two lineages resulting
										from the duplication event. The hierarchical orthologous groups (HOGs) are
										defined as sets of genes that have descended from a single common ancestor
										within a taxonomic range of interest, i.e. they correspond to the member of a
										clade in a gene tree rooted at the speciation node of interest.
										Which type of groups you should choose depends highly on the type of your
										analysis. For more specific information, consult the <a href="/oma/uses">page on
											typical uses</a>.</p>

								Why are OMA Groups often relatively small? Covering so many genomes, I expected
								them to be much bigger.
							</div>

							<div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne"
								 data-parent="#accordion">
								<div class="card-body">
									<p>For the OMA Groups, we apply a very stringent grouping strategy. All the members
										of a group need to be bona fide orthologs to each other, i.e. the form a clique
										in graph-theoretic terms. This grouping strategy is mainly intended for
										applications which require orthologs of high confidence, e.g. for reconstructing
										species trees. A gene tree built from the members of an OMA Group should - in
										absence of LGT are incomplete lineage sorting - be congruent with the underlying
										species tree. If you are interested in larger groups, consider using the OMA
										HOGs. These hierarchical orthologous groups are defined as set of genes that all
										started diverging from a single ancestral gene at a given time point of
										reference.</p>
