                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    The SARS-CoV-2 is a strain of coronavirus which causes the Covid19 disease in humans. Reaching a
                    peak in the spring of 2020, the world was affected by a pandemic, causing many negative impacts
                    on health, travel, the economy, education, and many other aspects of daily life. Out of this
                    tragedy however, new scientific interest in the field of virology and specifically of
                    coronaviruses has flourished. Scientists across the world are rapidly researching more into the
                    subject, journals have fast-tracked papers, and the world waits anxiously to understand more
                    about SARS-Cov-2 and to ultimately obtain a vaccine.
                </p>

                <h3>What is this?</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to facilitate the functional and evolutionary aspects of coronaviruses, we have created
                    the Corona OMA Browser. This is a website with all the functionality of the OMA Browser, but
                    for <a href="{% url "release" %}">119 Nidovirales</a> species. This encompasses the human SARS viruses, but also other
                    coronaviruses and other single-stranded RNA viruses. Some of these viruses affect humans, while
                    others affect bats, mice, horses, pigs, turkeys, cats, ferrets, etc. This browser is intended
                    to be a resource for researchers in the coronavirus community.
